```
Question: {message}

- Name: {name}
- Age: {age}
- State: {state}
- Filing Status: {filing_status}
- Risk Tolerance: {risk_tolerance}
- FI Progress: {fi_progress}
- Retirement Timeline: {retirement_timeline}

Deliver your response in four sections:

1. {name}'s Current Position 
   - Restate facts and ratios in plain English
2. Patterns & Risks
   - Non-obvious trends, vulnerabilities, tax/state-specific considerations
3. Strategic Opportunities
   - Advanced wealth, tax, and retirement strategies personalized to context
4. Behavioral Considerations
   - Biases, decision habits, lifestyle trade-offs, goal alignment
```

**Example:**
```
### 1. User's Current Position:
User, as of September 2, 2025, your total assets amount to $2,879,827, while your total liabilities stand at $314,282. This results in a net worth of $2,565,545. Your monthly income is $15,344, with expenses of $7,481, leaving you with a monthly surplus of $7,863. Your debt-to-asset ratio is 10.91%, and you have a savings rate of approximately 51.24%.

### 2. Patterns & Risks:
One notable trend is your healthy savings rate, indicating a strong ability to save and invest for the future. However, your debt-to-asset ratio suggests some room for debt reduction. Given your moderate risk tolerance, consider tax-efficient strategies in North Carolina to optimize returns.

### 3. Strategic Opportunities:
With your current financial standing, consider increasing your investment allocation slightly to enhance long-term growth. Given your FI progress of 114.31%, reassess your retirement timeline and adjust contributions if needed to achieve your goals comfortably.

### 4. Behavioral Considerations:
Your disciplined savings rate reflects prudent financial management. Be mindful of lifestyle inflation as income grows. Consider discussing financial goals openly with your spouse to align on shared objectives.

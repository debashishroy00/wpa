# Portfolio Optimization Research

## Modern Portfolio Theory Applications

### Risk-Return Optimization
Recent research shows that traditional 60/40 portfolios may need adjustment for current market conditions:
- Low interest rate environment reduces bond expected returns
- Increased correlation between stocks and bonds during stress periods
- Alternative assets can provide diversification benefits

### Factor-Based Investing
Academic research supports factor tilts for long-term investors:
- **Value premium**: 2-4% annual outperformance historically
- **Small cap premium**: 1-3% annual outperformance
- **Momentum factor**: Significant in shorter time periods
- **Quality factor**: Lower volatility with competitive returns

### International Diversification
- Home country bias remains prevalent among US investors
- International diversification can reduce portfolio volatility
- Emerging markets provide growth potential with higher volatility
- Currency hedging considerations for international bonds

### Rebalancing Research
- Annual rebalancing generally optimal for most investors
- Threshold-based rebalancing (5-10% drift) can improve returns
- Tax considerations important in taxable accounts
- Transaction costs must be considered

### Asset Location Optimization
Tax-efficient asset placement can add 0.1-0.5% annual return:
- Bonds in tax-advantaged accounts
- Growth stocks in Roth accounts
- Tax-efficient index funds in taxable accounts
- REITs in tax-advantaged accounts

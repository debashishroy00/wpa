# Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before implementing ANY feature, confirm:

## Current State Check
- [ ] Run `npm run check` - are there any errors?
- [ ] Run `npm run check:size` - note files already over 250 lines
- [ ] DO NOT modify any file already over 250 lines without refactoring first

## Quality Guidelines for All New Code
- [ ] New service files must be < 200 lines
- [ ] New component files must be < 150 lines
- [ ] New route files must be < 100 lines
- [ ] New model files must be < 100 lines
- [ ] Functions must be < 30 lines each
- [ ] API service files must be < 50 lines

## For Snapshot Feature Specifically
Create NEW files only, don't add to existing large files:

### Backend Files (Total: < 500 lines)
- [ ] `backend/app/models/snapshot.py` (< 100 lines)
- [ ] `backend/app/services/snapshot_service.py` (< 200 lines)  
- [ ] `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/snapshots.py` (< 100 lines)
- [ ] `backend/alembic/versions/xxx_add_snapshots.py` (migration)

### Frontend Files (Total: < 400 lines)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/SnapshotButton.tsx` (< 100 lines)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/SnapshotTimeline.tsx` (< 150 lines)
- [ ] `frontend/src/services/snapshotApi.ts` (< 50 lines)
- [ ] `frontend/src/types/snapshot.ts` (< 50 lines)

## Implementation Rules
- [ ] NEVER modify App.tsx (already 4,494 lines)
- [ ] NEVER add to files already over 300 lines
- [ ] Break functions into smaller pieces if they exceed 30 lines
- [ ] Extract reusable logic into separate utility files
- [ ] Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## Post-Implementation Verification
- [ ] Run `npm run check` - must pass with no errors
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` - must pass with no errors
- [ ] Test on mobile (375px width) - must be responsive
- [ ] Verify snapshot creation works end-to-end
- [ ] Verify timeline visualization displays correctly
- [ ] Check database migrations apply successfully

## Success Criteria
âœ… All new files under their size limits
âœ… No existing files modified beyond limits
âœ… Snapshot feature fully functional
âœ… Mobile responsive design
âœ… All quality checks pass
âœ… Database properly migrated

## Emergency Brakes
ðŸš¨ **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if:
- Any file exceeds its limit during development
- Quality check script returns errors
- TypeScript compilation fails
- Database migration fails

## Development Process
1. **Plan First**: Review this checklist completely
2. **Check Current**: Run quality checks to understand baseline
3. **Create Structure**: Start with models, then services, then routes, then UI
4. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each piece works before moving to next
5. **Final Verification**: Run all checks before considering complete

Remember: **Quality over speed**. It's better to have clean, maintainable code than to rush and create technical debt.

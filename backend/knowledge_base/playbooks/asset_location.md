# Asset Location Strategy

**KB-ID: AL-001**
**Category: Tax Optimization**
**Last Updated: 2024-12-16**

## Overview
Asset location (asset placement) refers to holding different types of investments in the most tax-efficient account types to maximize after-tax returns.

## Tax-Advantaged Account Priority

### Tax-Deferred Accounts (401k, Traditional IRA)
1. **Bonds and Fixed Income** - High priority
   - Corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, CDs
   - Bond funds and bond ETFs
   - REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
   - Rationale: Interest income taxed as ordinary income

2. **High-Turnover Actively Managed Funds**
   - Mutual funds with high turnover ratios
   - Short-term trading strategies
   - Rationale: Shields short-term capital gains

### Roth Accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401k)
1. **High-Growth Potential Assets** - Highest priority
   - Small-cap growth stocks
   - International/emerging market funds
   - Individual growth stocks
   - Rationale: Tax-free growth compounds over time

2. **Alternative Investments**
   - REITs in small amounts
   - Sector-specific ETFs
   - High-volatility assets

### Taxable Accounts
1. **Tax-Efficient Assets** - Preferred placement
   - Total stock market index funds
   - Broad market ETFs (VTI, VTIAX)
   - Individual blue-chip stocks held long-term
   - Municipal bonds (for high earners)

2. **Tax-Loss Harvesting Candidates**
   - Individual stocks or sector ETFs
   - Assets that can generate offsetting losses

## Implementation Rules

### Primary Allocation Strategy
```
Tax-Deferred (401k, Traditional IRA):
├── Bonds: 80-100% of fixed income allocation
├── REITs: 100% of REIT allocation
└── International bonds: 100% if held

Roth (Roth IRA, Roth 401k):
├── Small-cap growth: 100% of small-cap allocation
├── Emerging markets: 100% of EM allocation
└── High-growth individual stocks

Taxable (Brokerage):
├── US total market: Primary equity holding
├── International developed: Tax-efficient funds
└── Cash/short-term bonds: Liquidity needs
```

### Account Filling Order
1. **401k up to employer match** (free money)
2. **High-interest debt payoff** (guaranteed return)
3. **HSA maximum** (triple tax advantage)
4. **Roth IRA maximum** (tax-free growth)
5. **401k to maximum** (current tax savings)
6. **Taxable account** (remaining savings)

## Tax Rates and Thresholds

### Ordinary Income (Bonds, REITs)
- 10% bracket: $0 - $11,600 (single)
- 12% bracket: $11,601 - $47,150
- 22% bracket: $47,151 - $100,525
- 24% bracket: $100,526 - $191,950

### Long-Term Capital Gains (Stocks)
- 0% rate: Income up to $47,025 (single)
- 15% rate: Income $47,026 - $518,900
- 20% rate: Income above $518,900

### Foreign Tax Credit
International funds in taxable accounts can claim foreign tax credit
- Reduces double taxation on international dividends
- Not available in tax-deferred accounts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Inefficient Placement
❌ **Wrong**: Bonds in taxable account (taxed as ordinary income)
✅ **Right**: Bonds in 401k (deferred taxation)

❌ **Wrong**: Growth stocks in traditional IRA (converts cap gains to ordinary income)
✅ **Right**: Growth stocks in Roth IRA (tax-free forever)

❌ **Wrong**: Tax-efficient index funds in Roth
✅ **Right**: Tax-efficient funds in taxable (can harvest losses)

### Account Balance Considerations
- Don't sacrifice diversification for perfect asset location
- Small account balances may require compromise
- Rebalancing costs can outweigh tax benefits

## Quantified Benefits

### Tax Savings Examples
**High Earner (24% bracket) with $500k portfolio:**
- Optimal asset location: ~$2,000-4,000 annual tax savings
- Bond interest in 401k vs taxable: $1,200 annual savings
- Foreign tax credit in taxable: $300-600 annual benefit

**Moderate Earner (12% bracket) with $200k portfolio:**
- Optimal asset location: ~$500-1,200 annual tax savings
- Less dramatic but still meaningful over decades

### Long-Term Impact
30-year accumulation with optimal asset location can add 5-15% to final portfolio value compared to random placement.

## Implementation Checklist

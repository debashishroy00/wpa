## Foundational Studies

### Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz, 1952)
**Key Findings:**
- Diversification reduces risk without proportional return reduction
- Optimal portfolios lie on the "efficient frontier"
- Risk-return trade-off is fundamental to portfolio construction

**Practical Application:**
- Correlation <0.7 provides meaningful diversification benefits
- International diversification adds value despite higher costs
- Don't chase individual stock picking over broad diversification

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964)
**Key Insights:**
- Market portfolio is theoretically optimal for all investors
- Risk premium proportional to systematic risk (beta)
- Unsystematic risk can be diversified away

**Portfolio Implications:**
- Broad market index funds capture systematic returns efficiently
- Individual stock selection adds unrewarded risk
- Low-cost market exposure beats active management on average

## Equity Allocation Research

### Age-Based Allocation Rules

#### "100 Minus Age" Rule Origins
**Traditional Rule**: Equity % = 100 - Age
- **Age 30**: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- **Age 50**: 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- **Age 65**: 35% stocks, 65% bonds

**Modern Adjustments (120 Minus Age):**
- Accounts for longer lifespans
- Lower bond yields require more equity for growth
- **Age 30**: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- **Age 50**: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- **Age 65**: 55% stocks, 45% bonds

#### Target-Date Fund Glide Paths
**Vanguard Research (2013):**
- Age-appropriate glide paths improve outcomes
- Gradual decline from 90% to 30% equity over career
- Continue declining through retirement

**Fidelity Freedom Funds:**
- Start at 90% equity at age 25
- Reach 50% equity at retirement
- End at 20% equity 20 years into retirement

### International Diversification

#### Home Country Bias Studies
**Optimal International Allocation:**
- **US Total Market Cap**: ~60% of global markets
- **Recommended International**: 20-40% of equity allocation
- **Academic Optimal**: 30-50% based on market cap weighting

**Benefits Demonstrated:**
- 1970-2020: International added 0.1-0.3% annual return
- Reduced portfolio volatility by 5-15%
- Protection against US-specific risks

#### Emerging Markets Research
**MSCI Studies (1988-2024):**
- EM provides higher expected returns with higher volatility
- Correlation with developed markets: 0.6-0.8
- **Recommended Allocation**: 5-15% of total equity

**Implementation:**
- Can be included within international allocation
- Higher expense ratios acceptable for diversification benefit
- Consider currency hedging for large allocations

## Bond Allocation Research

### Bond Duration and Interest Rate Risk

#### Federal Reserve Studies
**Duration Impact:**
- 1% interest rate increase â†’ -Duration% bond price decline
- 10-year Treasury has ~9-year duration
- Shorter duration bonds provide stability during rate increases

**Optimal Duration Strategy:**
- Match duration to investment time horizon
- Use bond ladders for predictable income needs
- Intermediate-term (5-7 years) optimal for most portfolios

### Bond Type Allocation

#### Treasury vs Corporate vs Municipal
**Academic Consensus:**
- **Treasury**: Safest, lowest yield, best diversification
- **Corporate**: Higher yield, credit risk, less diversification
- **Municipal**: Tax benefits for high earners, lower pre-tax yields

**Allocation Framework:**
```
Bond Allocation by Tax Bracket:
Low Tax Bracket (<22%): 70% Treasury, 30% Corporate
Mid Tax Bracket (22-24%): 50% Treasury, 30% Corporate, 20% Municipal
High Tax Bracket (>24%): 40% Treasury, 20% Corporate, 40% Municipal
```

#### TIPS vs Nominal Bonds
**Inflation Protection Research:**
- TIPS provide inflation protection with lower expected returns
- **Recommended TIPS Allocation**: 20-40% of bond allocation
- Most valuable during inflationary periods

## Alternative Asset Research

### REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

#### Correlation and Diversification Studies
**Academic Findings (1972-2023):**
- REIT correlation with stocks: 0.6-0.7
- REIT correlation with bonds: 0.1-0.3
- Provides meaningful diversification despite equity-like volatility

**Optimal REIT Allocation:**
- **Conservative Recommendation**: 5-10% of total portfolio
- **Aggressive Recommendation**: 10-20% of equity allocation
- Geographic diversification (US and International REITs)

### Commodities Research

#### Portfolio Role Studies
**Yale Endowment Research:**
- Commodities provide inflation protection
- Low correlation with stocks and bonds
- High volatility requires small allocation

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Commodity futures show long-term negative returns
- Storage costs and contango effects
- **Practical Allocation**: 0-5% through broad commodity funds

### Cryptocurrency Research

#### Academic Analysis (2014-2024)
**Return Characteristics:**
- High volatility (60-80% annual standard deviation)
- Low correlation with traditional assets (0.1-0.3)
- Extreme drawdown risk (>80% declines observed)

**Portfolio Allocation Research:**
- **Maximum Recommended**: 5% of total portfolio
- Treat as speculative/alternative allocation
- Rebalance regularly due to high volatility

## Factor-Based Investing

### Value Premium Research

#### Fama-French Three-Factor Model (1993)
**Key Findings:**
- Value stocks outperform growth stocks over long periods
- Small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks
- Factors explain 90%+ of portfolio returns

**Historical Premiums (1928-2023):**
- **Value Premium**: 3-5% annual outperformance
- **Size Premium**: 1-3% annual outperformance
- **Market Premium**: 6-8% above risk-free rate

#### Implementation Research
**Dimensional Fund Advisors Studies:**
- Factor premiums exist but are not guaranteed
- Implementation costs can erode theoretical benefits
- Requires patient capital (10+ year time horizons)

**Factor Allocation Framework:**
- **Core Holdings**: 70-80% broad market funds
- **Factor Tilts**: 20-30% toward value/small-cap
- Avoid factor timing or dramatic overweights

### Momentum Research

#### Academic Evidence
**Jegadeesh and Titman (1993):**
- 3-12 month momentum predicts short-term returns
- Works across asset classes and geographic markets
- Can be combined with value for enhanced returns

**Practical Implementation:**
- Difficult to implement without frequent trading
- ETF implementations available but with higher costs
- Better suited for institutional/sophisticated investors

## Risk Parity and Alternative Weighting

### Risk Parity Research

#### Ray Dalio / Bridgewater Research
**Core Principles:**
- Weight assets by risk contribution, not dollar value
- Bonds receive higher weights due to lower volatility
- Use leverage to achieve target returns

**Academic Validation:**
- Risk parity provides more consistent returns
- Lower maximum drawdowns than cap-weighted portfolios
- Higher Sharpe ratios in most environments

#### Implementation for Individual Investors
- **Approximation**: 40% stocks, 60% bonds
- Use low-cost broad index funds
- Avoid leverage for individual implementations

### Equal Weight Research

#### Academic Studies (2003-2024)
**S&P Equal Weight vs Cap Weight:**
- Equal weight provides small-cap and value tilts
- Higher volatility but higher returns historically
- 0.5-1.0% annual outperformance over 20-year periods

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Higher turnover and transaction costs
- Tax inefficiency in taxable accounts
- Works best in tax-advantaged accounts

## Behavioral Finance and Asset Allocation

### Behavioral Biases Research

#### Common Allocation Mistakes
**Home Bias:** Overweighting domestic markets
- **Optimal International**: 30-50% of equity
- **Typical Allocation**: 5-15% international
- **Cost**: 0.2-0.4% annual return reduction

**Recency Bias:** Chasing recent performance
- **Research Finding**: Performance chasing reduces returns by 1-3% annually
- **Solution**: Systematic rebalancing and discipline

#### Mental Accounting Effects
**Richard Thaler Research:**
- Investors treat different accounts differently
- 401(k) allocation often more conservative than IRA
- **Solution**: View all accounts as single portfolio

### Target-Date Fund Research

#### Morningstar Studies (2020-2024)
**Effectiveness:**
- 85% of target-date investors stay on track vs 45% self-directed
- Automatic rebalancing provides 0.1-0.4% annual benefit
- Age-appropriate allocation reduces behavioral mistakes

**Limitations:**
- One-size-fits-all approach
- May not match individual risk tolerance
- Higher fees than index funds

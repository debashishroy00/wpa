DEPRECATED - retirement_response_template.py
This file is deprecated due to:
1. Indentation issues causing backend crashes
2. Overly complex data extraction logic
3. Hardcoded values and poor scalability
4. Inconsistent empty state handling

REPLACEMENT: retirement_response_formatter.py
Use the new simplified formatter instead.

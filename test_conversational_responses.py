Combined with projected investment growth of ${growth_component:,.0f} (using {rate_explanation}), your portfolio should reach ${final_amount:,.0f}.

This timeline assumes you maintain your current savings rate and investment approach. If you want to accelerate this, consider increasing your monthly contributions or exploring investment options that align with your risk tolerance.

The good news is that you're in a strong position - your current savings rate and asset base put you well on track for your retirement goals."""

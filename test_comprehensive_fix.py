Based on your current financial position, you're on track to reach your $3,500,000 retirement goal in approximately 4 years.

Here's how this works: Starting with your current assets of $2,565,545 and consistently adding your monthly surplus of $7,863, you'll save about $377,424 over this period. Combined with projected investment growth of $708,744 (using moderate conservative 6% rate for pre-retirement planning), your portfolio should reach $3,651,713.

This timeline assumes you maintain your current savings rate and investment approach. If you want to accelerate this, consider increasing your monthly contributions or exploring investment options that align with your risk tolerance.

The good news is that you're in a strong position - your current savings rate and asset base put you well on track for your retirement goals.
